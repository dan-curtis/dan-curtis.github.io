Hi, my name is Dan and I'm a UK-based Data Scientist with a background in maths.  

My aim for this blog is to have a place to write about things that I am passionate about, that may not be directly related to my work. On the maths side, I will likely focus heavily on Graph Theory, my subject of choice. For the code side, I intend to have tips and tricks that I find useful, with a probable focus on Python.  

This site is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll){:target="_blank"}, and a customised [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima){:target="_blank"} theme. Hopefully when it is a bit more established I will write some instructional posts on how I did it.
